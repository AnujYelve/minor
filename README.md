## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/library-management
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Email Configuration (Optional - for email notifications)
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com

   # Cloudinary Configuration (Required - for image uploads)
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```
   
   **Note**: Email notifications are optional. If email configuration is not provided, the system will continue to work with in-app notifications only.

4. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running on your system
   - Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local` if using a remote MongoDB instance

5. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   This will create:
   - 1 Admin user
   - 2 Store owners with their stores
   - 8 Books (4 per store)
   - 1 Test user

6. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🔐 Default Login Credentials

After seeding, you can use these credentials:

### Admin
- **Email**: admin@library.com
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

### Store Owner 1
- **Email**: store1@library.com
- **Username**: storeowner1
- **Password**: store123

### Store Owner 2
- **Email**: store2@library.com
- **Username**: storeowner2
- **Password**:   

### Test User
- **Email**: user@library.com
- **Username**: testuser
- **Password**: user123

## 🔄 Cron Job System

The system includes an automatic notification system powered by `node-cron`:

### Notification Rules

1. **On Book Issue** (when store confirms):
   - Message: "You issued 'BOOK_NAME' from STORE_NAME on DATE. Return before DUE_DATE."

2. **5 Days Before Due Date**:
   - Message: "Reminder: Return 'BOOK_NAME' within 5 days."

3. **After Due Date**:
   - Fine calculation: ₹5 per day
   - Notification every 10 days: "Your book is overdue. Current fine: ₹XXXX"

### Cron Job Implementation

- **Location**: `/lib/cron.js`
- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 9:00 AM
- **Manual Trigger**: `GET /api/cron` or `POST /api/cron`
- **Initialization**: Automatically initialized when the server starts

### How It Works

1. The cron job runs daily and checks all issued books
2. It calculates fines for overdue books
3. It sends reminders 5 days before due date
4. It sends fine notifications every 10 days for overdue books
5. All notifications are stored in the database and visible in the user dashboard
6. **Email notifications are sent in parallel** (if email configuration is provided)

## 🖼️ Image Upload & Display System

The system uses **Cloudinary** (free tier) for image hosting, keeping MongoDB free-tier friendly by storing only image URLs.

### How Image Upload Works

1. **Image Hosting**: Images are uploaded to Cloudinary, not stored in MongoDB
2. **URL Storage**: Only the Cloudinary image URL is stored in MongoDB (lightweight strings)
3. **Supported Images**:
   - **Store Images**: Store logo/photo (optional)
   - **Book Cover Images**: Book cover images (optional)

### Image Upload Features

- **File Types**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
- **File Size Limit**: Maximum 5MB per image
- **Automatic Optimization**: Cloudinary automatically optimizes images
- **Fallback Handling**: Placeholder images shown if upload fails or image missing

### Cloudinary Setup

1. **Create Free Account**:
   - Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Sign up for a free account (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)

2. **Get Credentials**:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Copy your:
     - Cloud Name
     - API Key
     - API Secret

3. **Add to Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

### Image Display

- **Store Dashboard**: Shows store image if uploaded
- **Book Cards**: Display book cover images in both store and user dashboards
- **Fallback**: Gray placeholder shown if no image is available

### MongoDB Free-Tier Friendly

- ✅ Images stored in Cloudinary (not MongoDB)
- ✅ Only URLs stored in database (lightweight strings)
- ✅ No database bloat
- ✅ Scalable architecture

## 📧 Email Notification System

The system supports **dual notification delivery**: both in-app notifications (stored in database) and email notifications (sent via SMTP).

### How Email Notifications Work

1. **Parallel Delivery**: When a notification is created, the system:
   - Creates an in-app notification (stored in database)
   - Sends an email notification (if email configuration is provided)

2. **Email Events**: Emails are sent for the same events as in-app notifications:
   - **Book Issue Confirmation**: When a store confirms a book issue
   - **5-Day Reminder**: 5 days before the book's due date
   - **Overdue Fine Notice**: Every 10 days for overdue books

3. **Email Content**: Email messages match the in-app notification content but are formatted as HTML emails with:
   - Professional styling
   - Color-coded headers (Blue for issues, Amber for reminders, Red for fines)
   - Clear, readable format

### Email Configuration

To enable email notifications, add the following to your `.env.local`:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com        # SMTP server host
EMAIL_PORT=587                   # SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com  # Your email address
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password     # Your email password or app password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com  # From address (usually same as EMAIL_USER)
```

### Gmail Setup Example

For Gmail, you'll need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password" (not your regular password)
3. Use the app password in `EMAIL_PASS`

**Steps**:
1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
4. Use this password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### Email Failure Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: If email sending fails, the system continues to work normally
- **In-app notifications always work**: Even if email fails, users still receive in-app notifications
- **Error Logging**: Email errors are logged but don't break the main application flow
- **Optional Feature**: Email notifications are completely optional - the system works fine without them

### Email Templates

The system uses HTML email templates with:
- **Subject Lines**:
  - "Book Issued Confirmation" for issue confirmations
  - "Book Return Reminder" for 5-day reminders
  - "Book Overdue Notice" for fine notifications
- **HTML Formatting**: Professional, responsive email design
- **Color Coding**: Visual indicators for different notification types
